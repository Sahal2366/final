  <h1><strong>Reach The Top</strong></h1>

<div class="containerTwo">
  <p>People love to say you can accomplish anything. I’m going to be completely honest with you, that’s not true.
    Very few people have the dedication and work ethic to operate in the top 1%.
    Those that do, often don’t know how to get there. Understand, if you’re dedicated and ready to work hard, it’s not enough, you need to know WHAT to work on, WHAT to dedicate yourself to. I did that with the help of Allah and I will teach you how. Learn the WHAT, then you just do the work.</p>

  <h1>Why you should join</h1>
</div>
<p>The main reason I named this Institute Al-Firdous is the end goal of everyones life is to get to the highest level of paradise and thats Al-Firdous. one of the main ways you can hopefully acheive this goal by the mercy of Allah is to strive to learn quran. The quran is the guide to mankinds life, and if you dont know that guide deeply and throughly you will be lost, as allah has said. One of the complaints of the prophet Muhammad was stated that in surah Al-Furqan Verse 30 "O my lord! Verily, My people deserted this Quran". Now my Qustion to you! Will you be from them? </p>
